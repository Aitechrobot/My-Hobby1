        <p>I like coding because you can explore so many cool things that no one has ever seen before. Coding lets you be free and make whatever you want. There are no boundaries, coding is limitless. coding can build robots and help so many people. Coding can make a difference in the world, one step at a time. Coding lets you think, and be methodical in what you are doing, coding helps you be really succesful in life. I started coding at age 5 and I have learned so much, I want to keep coding, and spreading the love of coding to others with the same passion as me.</p>
